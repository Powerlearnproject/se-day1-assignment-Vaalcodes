#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications
Software engineering provides the foundation of developing reliable, efficient and secure software applications hence acting as the drive force behind innovation in the technology industry,


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference. This event highlighted the software crisis where projects were becoming too complex, costly, and difficult to manage. The conference emphasized the need for systematic engineering approaches to software development, leading to structured programming methodologies and software development models like the **Waterfall Model**.
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s–1980s)- Traditional procedural programming had limitations in handling complex and scalable systems. The introduction of object-oriented programming (OOP), with languages like Smalltalk (1972), C++ (1983), and Java (1995), revolutionized software development. OOP improved code reusability, modularity, and maintainability, making software easier to manage and extend.
3. The Agile Revolution (2001 – Present)- In response to the inefficiencies of traditional heavyweight methodologies like Waterfall, the Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced principles focused on iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban have since dominated software development, enabling faster delivery, continuous improvement, and better responsiveness to changing requirements.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning– This is the phase where project goals, scope, feasibility, risks, and resources are identified. It ensures alignment with business needs and sets the foundation for the development process.  
2. Requirements Analysis– In this phase, stakeholders define and document functional and non-functional requirements. Techniques like interviews, surveys, and use case analysis help gather necessary details.  
3. Design – Software architects and designers create the system architecture, UI/UX design, database structure, and technology stack. High-level and detailed design documents guide development.  
4. Implementation (Coding)– Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase involves choosing the right programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build the software.  
5. Testing– The software is rigorously tested to identify bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities. Common testing types include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing .  
6. Deployment – Once testing is complete, the software is released for production use. This phase may involve phased rollouts, cloud deployment, or continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.  
7. Maintenance and Support – After deployment, the software requires ongoing updates, bug fixes, security patches, and performance improvements. This phase ensures the software remains functional and relevant over time.  


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfall – Best for Well-Defined, Predictable Projects that have clear requirements and minimal expected change
 Building a Banking System- Banking systems require strict regulatory compliance, security measures, and extensive documentation. Waterfall ensures all 
 requirements are thoroughly planned before implementation.  
 Aerospace or Medical Software Development- In industries where software must meet strict safety standards (e.g., aviation or healthcare), Waterfall’s structured 
 approach ensures compliance with industry regulations.  
 Agile – Best for Dynamic, Fast-Paced Projects that require continuous improvement and adaptability**.
 Mobile App Development- Since user preferences change frequently, Agile allows developers to quickly adapt and add new features based on feedback.  
 E-commerce Website- Agile enables continuous updates, testing, and feature enhancements, ensuring a competitive and user-friendly experience.  


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software solutions based on project requirements.  
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer ensures the software meets quality standards and is free of defects before deployment.  
Project Manager (PM)  oversees the planning, execution, and successful completion of software projects.  
    

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) streamline software development by providing a comprehensive suite of tools, making coding, debugging, and testing more efficient. They enhance productivity by integrating multiple features like code editing, debugging, automation, and syntax highlighting in one platform.  
Examples of IDEs: 
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code):Lightweight, supports multiple languages, and has extensive extensions.  
- PyCharm:Specializes in Python development with advanced debugging and AI-powered suggestions.
 Version Control Systems (VCS) is essential for tracking changes, managing code versions, and enabling team collaboration in software projects. It ensures that 
 code history is preserved and facilitates smooth teamwork by allowing multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.  
 Examples of VCS:
- Git: The most widely used distributed VCS, allowing for local and remote repositories.  
- GitHub: A cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories, used for collaboration.
